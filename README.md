### Description

This code implements a **Three-Level Password System** designed to enhance security through multiple layers of authentication. It combines traditional password mechanisms with additional features to protect user accounts from unauthorized access. Hereâ€™s how the system works and what the code is designed to achieve:

#### Key Features:

1. **Textual Password**: 
   - Users create a standard textual password.
   - The password is hashed using a custom hashing function combined with a salt value.
   - To further secure the password, it undergoes stretching (repeated hashing) to resist brute-force attacks.

2. **Graphical Password**: 
   - Users set a graphical password consisting of a pattern of 5 integers.
   - During login, users must correctly enter this pattern to gain access.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - Users provide a two-factor authentication code.
   - This code is validated against the stored code for additional security.

4. **Account Lockout**:
   - The system tracks failed login attempts.
   - After a maximum number of failed attempts (3), the account is locked to prevent further login attempts.

#### Detailed Functionality:

1. **Sign Up**:
   - Users choose a username, set a textual password, define a graphical password pattern, and provide a 2FA code.
   - The system hashes and salts the textual password, stores the graphical password, and saves the 2FA code.
   - Accounts are initialized with zero failed login attempts and are not locked.

2. **Login**:
   - Users provide their username and must enter their textual password, graphical password pattern, and 2FA code.
   - The system validates each component:
     - Textual password is hashed and checked.
     - Graphical password pattern is compared.
     - 2FA code is verified.
   - If any component is incorrect, the system increments the failed attempts counter.
   - After reaching the maximum allowed attempts, the account is locked.

3. **User Database**:
   - Maintains an in-memory database of users, including their hashed password, graphical password, 2FA code, failed attempts count, and lock status.

4. **User Interface**:
   - Provides a simple console menu for users to sign up, log in, or exit the program.
   - Handles invalid input and ensures users can navigate through the options easily.

### Goals Achieved:

- **Enhanced Security**: 
  - By combining textual passwords with graphical passwords and 2FA, the system significantly strengthens authentication.
  - Hashing, salting, and stretching the password adds layers of security against common attack vectors.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - The system features a straightforward console-based interface for interaction.
  - Prompts guide users through the sign-up and login processes clearly.

- **Account Protection**:
  - Locking accounts after multiple failed attempts prevents brute-force attacks and protects against unauthorized access.

Overall, the Three-Level Password System aims to provide robust security while maintaining ease of use and simplicity in the authentication process.
